### SDSC Summer Institute 2024
# Session 4.3a Conducting Scientific Visualization with VTK and Unreal Engine 5

**Date:** Wednesday, August 7, 2023

**Summary**: This tutorial will provide a high-level overview of scientific visualization techniques with two open-source software suites. We will primarily cover structured mesh-based data, but we will address other commonly encountered datasets such as point clouds and geographic data as well. Attendees will employ a state-of-the-art game engine to render 3D scenes containing scientific data. This is a hands-on workshop that will require an adequate computer and the installation of large software packages.
